This repo started as gov-oss.org and has been forked to tell the history of developments in NYC's open data and open government communities. This repo was forked from Gunnar Hellekson and Karl Fogel and repurposed by Noel Hidalgo and Luis Godoy.

Materials:

    oss-timeline.html        -- The timeline page one browses to.
    oss-timeline.js          -- Custom JavaScript for timeline.
    archive/                 -- Backups of some source materials.
    Overpass-fonts/          -- Copies of the Overpass font, used in the presentation.

To host the timeline (not that you really need to, since it's already
online at http://gov-oss.org), you'd want the Simile Timeline widget code:

    http://www.simile-widgets.org/timeline/

which provides the "simile-ajax-api.js" and "timeline-api.js" files
(referenced from the HTML headers), and the files + images they load.

If you do host this yourself, you should note that we've included a Google
Analytics tracker in the footer of the HTML file. That will (presumably) help
us understand where the code is being used. If you don't like it, feel free
to delete it!
