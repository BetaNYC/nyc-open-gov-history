See http://www.oscon.com/oscon2012/public/schedule/detail/24221.

Materials:

    oss-timeline.html -- The file people actually browse to.
    oss-timeline.ods  -- Backup of the Google Spreadsheet (bit.ly/LH6ShG)
    oss-timeline.js   -- Custom JavaScript.

To use this, you'll also need the Simile Timeline widget code:

which provides the "simile-ajax-api.js" and "timeline-api.js" files
referenced from the HTML headers, and the files and images they load.
